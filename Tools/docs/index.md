# Tools Training Guide

> [!CAUTION]
> **Read Carefully Before Copy-Pasting**
>
> This documentation is designed to build **real debugging and problem-solving skills**.
> Some examples may include **intentional mistakes, edge cases, or incomplete commands** that you are expected to analyze and fix.
>
> **Always:**
>
> * Read the full example before running it
> * Understand what each command or option does
> * Execute commands step-by-step
> * Observe errors and learn from them
>
> Blind copy-pasting leads to shallow learning.
> **Debugging is a core skill.**

## Welcome! 👋

This guide is a **hands-on, practical training series** covering essential **developer tools** used in real-world backend and API development.

Whether you are a beginner or already working with APIs and databases, this guide will help you **understand, not just use**, the most important tools every backend developer must know.

---

## 🧰 Tools Covered

This guide currently includes:

* **cURL** – Command-line HTTP client
* **Postman** – API testing and debugging
* **Git** – Version control and collaboration
* **SQL** – Querying and managing relational databases

Each tool is treated as a **separate learning track**, but they complement each other and are often used together in real projects.

---

## 📚 How This Guide Is Structured

Each tool follows a **progressive, step-by-step approach**:

* Start from fundamentals
* Move toward real-world usage
* Emphasize *why* things work, not just *how*

You are encouraged to:

* Experiment
* Break things
* Fix them
* Understand error messages

---

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy

### 1️⃣ Learn by Doing

Reading is not enough. You must **run commands**, **send requests**, and **observe results**.

### 2️⃣ Debug First, Memorize Later

Errors are not problems — they are **teachers**.

### 3️⃣ Tools Are Not Magic

Every flag, option, and command exists for a reason.
We explain those reasons clearly.

## 🛠️ Tools Overview & Entry Points

### 🔹 cURL

Learn how HTTP really works under the hood using the command line.

* Making GET / POST requests
* Headers, query params, JSON bodies
* Authentication tokens
* Debugging APIs without any UI

➡️ Start here: **cURL → Guide**

---

### 🔹 Postman

Master API testing the professional way.

* Collections & environments
* Authorization methods
* Pre-request scripts
* Automated testing
* Debugging backend APIs

➡️ Start here: **Postman → Basics**

---

### 🔹 Git

Understand version control properly (not just `git push`).

* Repositories and commits
* Branching and merging
* Resolving conflicts
* Real-world Git workflows

➡️ Start here: **Git → Guide**

---

### 🔹 SQL

Learn SQL **step-by-step**, from beginner to confident query writer.

The SQL track is structured like a course:

* Introduction & setup
* Querying and filtering data
* Joins, grouping, and subqueries
* Modifying data safely
* Data types, constraints, and table management

➡️ Start here: **SQL → Home**

## ⏱️ Estimated Time Commitment

| Tool    | Estimated Time |
| ------- | -------------- |
| cURL    | 2–3 hours      |
| Postman | 5–8 hours      |
| Git     | 6–10 hours     |
| SQL     | 15–25 hours    |

**Total**: ~30–45 hours (self-paced)

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required

* Basic computer usage
* Command line basics (`cd`, `ls`, running commands)

### Helpful (but not mandatory)

* Basic programming knowledge
* Understanding of APIs or web applications

---

## 🧠 How to Use This Guide Effectively

1. **Go in order** within each tool
2. **Run every command yourself**
3. **Pause when something breaks**
4. **Read the error message**
5. **Fix it before moving on**

If something feels confusing — that’s expected.
Confusion is part of learning tools deeply.

---

## 🐛 Common Beginner Mistakes (Across All Tools)

* Copy-pasting commands without understanding flags
* Ignoring error messages
* Skipping setup steps
* Mixing concepts between tools (e.g., Postman vs cURL)

We intentionally highlight these mistakes so you **learn to avoid them early**.
